# Cuis-Mathematics
A computational algebra system in Smalltalk.

This is a continuation of some projects started in MathMorphs, after a pause of about 19 years (!). Still far from finished, but steadily growing and getting better.

This is not about scientific computing and numerical algorithms. This is more about abstract algebra and exact computation. It includes support for performing some computations in group theory, commutative algebra, combinatorics, algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, algebraic number theory and coding theory.
