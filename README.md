# Cuis-Mathematics
A computational algebra system in Smalltalk ([Cuis Smalltalk](https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev) more precisely).

This is a continuation of some projects started in the MathMorphs group in the University of Buenos Aires in 1997 and 1998.

This is *not* about scientific computing or numerical algorithms. This is more about abstract algebra and exact computation. The goal is to build an extensible and mathematically rigurous environment where one can construct mathematical objecs (such as groups, rings, modules, algebraic varieties, graphs, etc) and operate with them. It currently includes support for performing some computations in group theory, combinatorics, commutative algebra, algebraic geometry and coding theory.
