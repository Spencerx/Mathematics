# Cuis-Mathematics
A computational algebra system in Smalltalk.

This is a continuation of some projects started in MathMorphs, after a pause of about 19 years (!).

This is *not* about scientific computing or numerical algorithms. This is more about abstract algebra and exact computation. The goal is to build an extensible and mathematically rigurous environment where one can construct mathematical objecs (such as groups, rings, modules, algebraic varieties, graphs, etc) and operate with them. It includes support for performing some computations in group theory, commutative algebra, combinatorics, algebraic geometry and coding theory.

For more details refer to the [online documentation](https://github.com/len/Cuis-Mathematics/wiki) in the wiki.
